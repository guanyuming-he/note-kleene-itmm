M ~1 N1
N ~2 M1

A0 := M - M1

if m in M1 = M-A0 (case 1)
	find n in N by ~2
otherwise (m in A0) (case 2)
	find n in N by ~1

This is not 1-to-1. Let m in A0. It has a n by ~1; but for any n, we have
anothre m' in M by ~2. This m' must be in M1 and thus m != m', for the same n.
m correspond to n by case 2, while m' correspond to n by case 1. This shows
that this rule does not produce a 1-to-1.

To fight against this obstacle, consider if we can remove some influence of
case 2 so that it doesn't fill that entirety of N. 

Which ones of M1 to remove? How about we remove all possible such m's mentioned
earlier? Such m' are produced by mapping A0 to N by ~1 and back to M1 by ~2.
Call it A1. By definition, A1 is disjoint with A0. We will need to refer to the
set of mapping A0 to N, and I refer it to B0.

Nice, so updated case 1 and case 2 are:
if m in M-A0-A1 (case 1)
	find n in N my ~2
otherwise
	find n in N by ~1

Does this eliminate the problem?  Let m0 in A0+A1. We have
m0 ~1 n0 ~2 m1. 
If m0 is in A0, then by definition, m1 is in A1. For this m1 we can't say too
much, because it doesn't fall under case 1. But what if m0 is in A1, or what if
we continue digging from m1?

We have m0 ~1 n0 ~2 m1 ~1 n1 ~2 m2. 
1. Because M1 is disjoint with A0, This m2 doesn't belong to A0.
2. m1 is in A1, disjoint from A0. Because ~1 is 1-to-1, it follows that the set
of all n1 must be disjoint from that of all n0, B0. Call the former B1. Because
~2 is one-to-one, the set of m2's, A2  must be disjoint from that of m1's, A1.

Thus, these m2's belong to neither A0 nor A1. 
Because m1 ~1 n1, m1 and n1 are matched under the new rule by case 2. Because
n1 ~2 m2, they are also matched under the new rule by case 1. Again, this new
rule is still not a 1-to-1.

Continuing with this infinitely, and we will have the situation discussed in
the book.
